Hi Welcome

Chat Interface
This project aims to create a simple chat interface using HTML and CSS. The interface consists of a sidebar and a message content section.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to showcase a basic chat interface built using HTML and CSS. The interface includes a sidebar displaying users' names, profile pictures, and their latest messages. The message content section displays the conversation with the selected user.

Usage
Click on a user's name in the sidebar to open the chat with that user.
Use the text input box in the message content section to send new messages.
Options for sending emojis, recording audio, and sending images are available.

I write this code for my basic html and css skills. You can use it.
